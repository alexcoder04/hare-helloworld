# Hare - Hello World!

[Hare](https://harelang.org/) is a new programming language started by
[Drew Devault](https://drewdevault.com/). From my feeling so far, it is a little
similar to [Go](https://go.dev/).

This repository is mainly me playing with Hare and testing stuff out, however it
can be used as a kind of (non-comprehensive) overview/tutorial.

Some code here is taken/adopted from the official introduction tutorial.
